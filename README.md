# Recipe Finder App

## Overview

The **Recipe Finder App** is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on various filters like text query (recipe name), cuisine type, and preparation time. The app fetches recipe data from the Spoonacular API and displays relevant results on the `RecipesViewer` page.

This application is built with the following technologies:
- **Next.js 15.1.7**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Daisy UI** (adds component class names to Tailwind CSS)

  - The app uses dynamic routing to display a list of recipes based on the userâ€™s search parameters.
  - Pages include `Home` (landing page) and `Recipes` (results page) and `[recipe-id]` slug for specific recipes.
  
- **Data Fetching:**
  - The app interacts with the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data.
  - `Suspense` is used for handling async operations and loading states.

- **Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS is used for utility-based styling.
